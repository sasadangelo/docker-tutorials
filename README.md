# Docker Tutorials

This is a set of tutorials I created for my [Getting Started with Docker](http://code4projects.altervista.org/series/getting-started-with-docker/) series on Code4Projects website. The goal of the series is to show you how I use Docker in my day by day job. To do that I created a set of tutorials that, step by step, show you how to create and deploy a complex application with Docker.

As example, I decided to show you how to create a PostgreSQL cluster starting from a simple "Hello World!" application to a whole PostgreSQL cluster.

The application you choose to learn Docker is not very important, what is really important is to understand the basic Docker concepts and how to apply them in real projects.

The following is a list of tutorials.

## Hello World

In this tutorial, I will show you how to create a simple "Hello World!" application. We will create a container with a Web Server (Nginx) listeining on port 80. When the container will be up and running we can connect to it via browser and the "Hello World!" message will appear in it.

## PostgreSQL

In this tutorial, I will show you how to create a container with a PostgreSQL instance running in it and listening on 432 port.
